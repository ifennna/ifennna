### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend engineer focused on shipping reliable systems. 

I have several years of production experience with languages like Typescript, Go, Rust and Javascript as well technologies like MongoDB, Postgres, GCP, gRPC, GraphQL, Docker containers and microservices. I've built and shipped products in sectors like DeFi, fintech, oil servicing and organizational productivity.

Feel free to reach me at jawagu@gmail.com, especially if you're building a product that has tangible social impact.
